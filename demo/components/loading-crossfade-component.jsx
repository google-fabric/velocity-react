// Component for a VelocityTransitionGroup that crossfades between its children.
//
// To use this component, render with a single child that contains the "loading" version of your
// UI. When data has loaded, switch the "key" of this child so that React considers it a brand
// new element and triggers the enter / leave effects. The two versions of the UI are expected to
// have identical heights.
//
// Properties on this component (such as "style") are applied to the VelocityTransitionGroup
// component that this delegates to. We set the VelocityTransitionGroup's container to a <div> by
// default, and provide enter and leave animations, though these could be overridden if it makes
// sense for your use case. A position: 'relative' style is also applied by default since the loading
// effect requires position: 'absolute' on the child.
//
// This component defines a "duration" property that is used for both the enter and leave animation
// durations.
//
// Use the property "opaque" if the children have opaque backgrounds. This will make the new element
// come in 100% opacity and fade the old element out from on top of it. (Without this, opaque
// elements end up bleeding the background behind the LoadingCrossfadeComponent through.)
