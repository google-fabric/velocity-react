Component to add Velocity animations to one or more children. Wraps a single child without adding
additional DOM nodes.

The API attempts to be as declarative as possible. A single animation property declares what
animation the child should have. If that property changes, this component applies the new animation
to the child on the next tick.

By default, the animation is not run when the component is mounted. Instead, Velocity's "finish"
command is used to jump to the animation's end state. For a component that animates out of and
back in to a default state, this allows the parent to specify the "animate into" animation as
the default, and therefore not have to distinguish between the initial state and the state to
return to after animating away.

Properties:
 animation: Either an animation key or hash defining the animation. See Velocity's documentation
   for what this can be. (It is passed to Velocity exactly.)
 runOnMount: If true, runs the animation even when the component is first mounted.
 targetQuerySelector: By default, this component's single child is animated. If targetQuerySelector
   is provided, it is used to select descendants to apply the animation to. Use with caution, only
   when you're confident that React's reconciliation will preserve these nodes during animation.
   Also note querySelectorAll's silly behavior w.r.t. pruning results when being called on a node.
   A special value of "children" will use the direct children of the node, since there isn't a
   great way to specify that to querySelectorAll.
 interruptBehavior: Sets how the previous animation should behave when the "animation" prop is
   changed before itâ€™s done. Default is "stop", which halts the animation where it is. "finish"
   will jump the animation to its completed appearance. "queue" will run the new animation after
   the previous one has finished.

Unrecognized properties are passed as options to Velocity (e.g. "duration", "delay", "loop").

Methods:
 runAnimation: Triggers the animation immediately. Useful for when you want an animation that
   corresponds to an event but not a particular model state change (e.g. a "bump" when a click
   occurs).
